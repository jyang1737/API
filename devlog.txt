    added upload.py file
    Need to do some research into post requests as right now it only returns information if a url to an image is given and not a local one.
    On the brightside, upload.getlist(path) now returns a list of tags about the image located at the url specified by path

nicoleC -- 2016-12-07 02:30
    Modified song.py to include requests
    Authorization errors when requests made -- big buggy :(

    merged query(L) and get_tracks(L) into get_tracks(tags)
        takes a list of tags
	returns list of ids of songs most relevant to songs
	    now starts from first tag, and moves onto others until a list of 10 is formed
