	   added upload.py file. Need to do some research into post requests as right now it only returns information if a url to an image is given and not a local one. On the brightside, upload.getlist(path) now returns a list of tags about the image located at the url specified by path

    Modified musixmatch.py to include requests
    Authorization errors when requests made -- big buggy :(
    List of things that need to be installed can be found in README file
