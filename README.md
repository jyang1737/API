## Live Song and Prosper

 ### This site takes your images and returns a song about them. Perfect for the bar-mitzvah slide show or the ideal musical birthday card. 

How it Works: <br>
   1. A user either upload an image or pastes a link to an image from the home page. <br>
   2. The user is either redirected to an error page or to a page, with background colors similiar to the ones in the image, that lists the words correspodning to the image and songs that contained such words. <br>
   3. The user can click on each song to view the author and lyrics of each song. <br>
   
   
   
   Note:
   to make upload functionality work, we used the poster module to encode file data. The files are included in utils, so not pip is neccessary.
