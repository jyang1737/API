Front-End: 
	-Navbar only has home and about page
		Reason: It made more sense design wise to have the user input from the main page
	-Home page allows user to upload an image or link to an image
		  Reason: Users are not forced to download and upload an image
	-An invalid input redirects the user to an error page
		  Reason: This stops bad urls and images from breaking the app
	-Song List and Each Song has background colors that correspond to the image
		Reason: It was another application of the Clairifai API
